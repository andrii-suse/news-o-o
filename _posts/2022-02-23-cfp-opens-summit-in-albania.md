The [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) community has opened the call for papers for a summit that will be held in conjunction with Open Source Conference Albania [(OSCAL)](https://oscal.openlabs.cc/) 2022.

People can submit a talk for the [openSUSE Summit at OSCAL 2022](https://events.opensuse.org/) from now until April 26 on [events.opensuse.org](https://events.opensuse.org/).

[OSCAL](https://oscal.openlabs.cc/) will take place from June 18 and 19 in Tirana, Albania, and will gather free (libre) open source technology users, developers, academics, governmental agencies and people who share the idea that software should be free and open for people to study, develop and customize. The conference is organized by [Open Labs](https://openlabs.cc/en/), which is a non-profit community that promotes the importance of an open source culture in Albania since 2012. 

The [openSUSE Summit at OSCAL 2022](https://events.opensuse.org/) will take place on one day of  [OSCAL](https://oscal.openlabs.cc/) and people are encouraged to submit a talk about openSUSE and open source. There are two talks that can be submitted for the summit. One is a short talk with a 10-minute limit and the other is a normal talk with a 30-minute limit.

The summit will be a hybrid event, so people can submit talks for presentation at the event or submit a talk and do it virtually if they are unable to travel to Albania. 

Some attendees who want to travel to the conference and summit may be required to apply for a visa. If an attendee requires [visa approval](https://albania.al/visa-procedures/), they can email nafie.shehu (at) gmail.com to assist with an invitation to the conference. All attendees traveling to the conference/summit require the following: 
* have a valid passport;
* have enough money for each day of their stay;
* be able to demonstrate the purpose of your stay to border officials;
* pose no threat to public order, national security or international relations.

For more information, visit [Albaniaâ€™s Federal Foreign Office](https://albania.al/visa-procedures/) website.
