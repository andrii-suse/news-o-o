[openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/) [Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) started the new year just like it finished the last; on a roll and giving users freshly updated software packages.

The rolling release has been on a daily release streak since the beginning of December and since the beginning of October has only missed one daily snapshot; :open_mouth: !

The latest snapshot to arrive was [20230111](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/F7PLDS44YFZUFSDXUKENDXT55WYRYXQR/) and it brought an update in  [yast2](https://github.com/yast/yast-yast2) that gives help text within the YaST Control Center from the 4.5.21 update. A migration of the [Pluggable Authentication Module](https://github.com/linux-pam/linux-pam) settings to `/usr/lib/pam.d` took place in a [samba](https://www.samba.org/) 4.17.4+git update. There was a 1.0.2+git update with [kdump](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kdump/kdump.html), which improved the generation of `calibrate.conf`; it uses static IP addresses for calibration. The package also fixed [s390x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_on_IBM_Z#Hardware)  build dependencies and fixed the package summary in the [spec file](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Specfile_guidelines). The second [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) update this week arrived in this snapshot; kernel-source 6.1.4 fixed the [grub2](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/) menu handling for rebooting. [Advanced Linux Sound Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture) changes with the kernel update applied a dual codec fixup for [Dell Latitude](https://www.dell.com/) laptops. An update from this year of [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses) improves configure-script macros vs compiler warnings, and [vim](https://www.vim.org/)'s benevolent dictator for life [Bram Moolenaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar) suggested [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses) add an RV report+version, which was implemented in the release, according to the changlog. Several other packages updated in the snapshot, which included several libqt5 cross-platform application and User Interface framework packages. 

Snapshot [20230110](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/PP5JUAFTPD3XUURWBGZ2TTF3WIAIUZLO/) updated a package that several small or embedded system developers are finding useful; [busybox](https://busybox.net/), which combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. This package fixes a [Common Vulnerability and Exposure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures). [CVE-2022-30065](https://www.suse.com/de-de/security/cve/CVE-2022-30065.html) did not properly sanitize while processing a crafted `awk` pattern, leading to possible code execution. The package also had various other fixes and enabled [SHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_SHA_extensions) hardware acceleration. [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/)’s virtual file system  [gvfs](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs) updated to version 1.50.3 and fixes hangs when a connection is released. It also prevent automounts from resuming after a suspension, and the package update adds support for xx-large and x-large thumbnails. Notification about unprepared critical updates were stopped in the [gnome-software](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-software) 43.3 update. GNOME’s [evolution](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evolution) 3.46.3 fixed a few [memory leaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak) and some bugs; like a crash when [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) is reading a feed with an empty author, or like duplicating of attachments when forwarding personal information management application. The image processing package [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/index.html) updated to version 1.3.39 and added new features like support reading [AV1 Image File Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVIF) via [libheif](https://github.com/strukturag/libheif) if it supports the decoding of AVIF. Members of the project and its principal maintainer are asking for volunteers to help maintain the 26-year-old package. An update of [php8](https://www.php.net/) 8.1.14 took care of [CVE-2022-31631](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2022-31631), which occurred due to an uncaught integer overflow that made it possible to force the function to return a single apostrophe if the function is called on user-supplied input without any length restrictions in place. The package fixed several bugs including two failures related to [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/). Along with [yast2-installation](https://github.com/yast/yast-installation) and [yast2-trans](https://software.opensuse.org/package/yast2-trans) several other packages updated in the snapshot.

A total of two packages updated in the [20230109](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/U5QIWKTMLN54EEFEPKXRYJKUGC6OT4JU/) snapshot. One of the packages, [hidapi](https://github.com/libusb/hidapi), updated for version 0.13.0. The library for communicating with USB and Bluetooth devices added a [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) build script and added support for devices over the [Serial Peripheral Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface), which is an interface specification used for short-distance communication primarily with [embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system). The other package to update was [libmfx](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/media-sdk/overview.html) 22.6.5. The Intel Media SDK dispatcher library package added security reporting information.

Three packages were updated in snapshot [20230108](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/5S2AHIMUM6NUP72YZ3PGGYQ64MZJOM4K/). The updates included [libstorage-ng](https://github.com/openSUSE/libstorage-ng) 4.5.62 receiving updated Macedonian translations using [Weblate](https://weblate.org/). A major version [python-cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) dropped support for [LibreSSL](https://www.libressl.org/) below version 3.5. The 39.0.0 cryptographic package also removed support for [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) 1.1.0. The tool that generates smaller dumpfiles from kdump memory dumps was the last package to update. This 1.7.2 [makedumpfile](https://github.com/makedumpfile/makedumpfile) added support for the [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) update to version 6.0 that is specific to [x86_64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64).
   
The 44.1 major version of [gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit) arrived in snapshot [20230107](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/WIW6R2MJWCUZRUMTQTI7FDO2UFKRQY5V/). The general-purpose text editor had some code refactorings, updated translations and makes more use of [Tepl](https://github.com/albfan/tepl) features related to [GtkSourceView-based](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GtkSourceView). [KDE Gear 22.12.1](https://kde.org/announcements/gear/22.12.1/) had tons of fixes. [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) has a new camera proxy for the Akaso action camera. The video editing package fixed a couple crashes like one where the app kept dropping an effect with a scene and a zoom that was behaving incorrectly. An update of [KMail](https://apps.kde.org/kmail2/) fixed a bug where opening a progress window did nothing and a fix for [Kontact](https://apps.kde.org/kontact/) crashing upon startup. The [kitinerary](https://github.com/KDE/kitinerary) added support for international tickets with Italy’s primary train operator [Trenitialia](https://www.trenitalia.com). Several other [KDE Gear](https://kde.org/announcements/gear/22.12.1/) packages were updated in the snapshot. An update of [systemd](https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) 252.4 added several patches and fixed [CVE-2022-4415](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-4415.html), which was a security flaw that could cause a local-information leak due to systemd-coredump not respecting a kernel setting. A [CVE-2022-46908](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-46908.html) patch was dropped and SQL functions removed related to its harmful side-effects with the update of [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) 3.40.1; the script did not properly implement the [azProhibitedFunctions](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-993x-6558-2xmj) protection mechanism. The [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) package also fixed a potential infinite loop in alternative memory. A crash that might occur when managing browser history was fixed with [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org) 108.0.2 update. There were several other packages updated in the snapshot including [firewalld](https://firewalld.org/) 1.3.0, [btrfsprogs](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) 6.1.2, [zypper](https://github.com/openSUSE/zypper) 1.14.59 and more. 

Chess players using GNOME will have a keyboard shortcut fix with [gnome-chess](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Chess) 43.1, which arrived in snapshot [20230106](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/YESUGMMMDCVEHLCMPQXPGNKPA6BXACLX/). The screen reader for those with no or limited sight will benefit from the [Orca](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Orca) 43.1 update. There were many bug fixes with the speech and refreshable braille package, which included several issues related to preferring the TableCell interface and a fix for repetition of text elements during Orca's Say All command for web content. Bugfix release [KDE Plasma 5.26.5](https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.26.5/) fixed the initialization order with `KSignalHandler` in the [kscreenlocker](https://github.com/KDE/kscreenlocker) package. There was a fix for connecting to WPA3-personal networks in the [plasma-nm](https://github.com/KDE/plasma-nm) update. The [KDE](https://kde.org) update also brought many fixes for the Window Manager and Wayland Compositor [KWin](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin). [One of those](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/commit/e72294d8bff83c9296546d1e1dee2979113fcd86) requires a reboot after changing a primary selection option. There was an update of [fetchmail](https://www.fetchmail.info/) 6.4.35 that now warns about [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) with version before 1.1.1s or 3.0.7, and the update rejects [wolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/) older than version 5.5.0. It also updated Swedish and [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) translations. The super-thin layer on the DBus interface [fwupd](https://fwupd.org/) added many new features in the 1.8.9  update. It added [SHA384](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) support for [Trusted Platform Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module) hashes and categories like X-FingerprintReader, X-GraphicsTablet, X-Dock and X-UsbDock. The kernel received it’s first update of the week in this snapshot from last Friday.
