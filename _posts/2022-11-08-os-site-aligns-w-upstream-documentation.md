The history of documentation as it relates to operating systems and software development has a rich history that expands decades. 

The founding of [manual pages](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Manual_pages), or manpages for short, were a way to onboard new technology users at a time when household computers were nonexistent. 

To gain knowledge of programs, standards, abstract concepts and conventions, a person needed computer access and to enter the `man` command to display documentation in a green text encoding standard about the computer program on the system.

Times and technology have changed, but the purpose of manpage hasn't. 

Users no longer need to install a package on their system to access a program’s documentation thanks to the openSUSE Project’s repository of manual pages at [manpages.opensuse.org](https://manpages.opensuse.org). 

There are a couple of different ways to use the manpages repository. People can [browse the repository index](https://manpages.opensuse.org/Tumbleweed/index.html), which features thousands of packages (curently 111,387), enter the package in the search or enter the /name of the package in the URL.  

The manpages repository follow upstream manual pages in [openSUSE Factory](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Factory) and translations are based on these upstream translation efforts for each software package.

Service for [manpages.opensuse.org](https://manpages.opensuse.org) will improve and updates to each of the packages manpage will happen as new packages enter [openSUSE Factory](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Factory).

A link will soon be displayed on the [project’s portal](https://github.com/openSUSE/universe-o-o/) to all of [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/) websites, user groups, [social media accounts](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Communication_channels#Social_networks) and more.
