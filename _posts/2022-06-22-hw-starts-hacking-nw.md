It’s back. No, not the McRib. It’s [Hack Week](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/). 

The coveted [Hack Week](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/) 21 runs from June 27 to July 1 and has both virtual and physical participation elements. [Hack Week](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/) is put on for [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) contributions and gives any open-source contributor and [SUSE](https://www.suse.com/) employees a playground to experiment, innovate, collaborate and learn for an entire week.

People all over the world can create, view or join projects on [hackweek.opensuse.org](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/). The projects range from the packaging of freeware games to improving full-disk encryption and from learning network related knowledge to writing a [software.opensuse.org](https://software.opensuse.org/) replacement. There is even a project using solar panels to regulate water heating. There are more than 80 projects for this year’s [Hack Week](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/). 

Companies, hobbyists and technologists are encouraged to participate. There is no affiliation one needs to participate in [Hack Week](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/). 

The efforts are all about being innovative and providing solutions for users, developers and industry. The theme for this [Hack Week](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/) is Hacking for Humanity! 

[Hack Week](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/) has been running since 2007 and  you can find out [how it works](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/faqs) by joining a project.
