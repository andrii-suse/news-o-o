There is big news brewing!  SUSE has reconsidered setting the minimum architecture baseline for [ALP](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/SUSE:ALP) from the originally announced x86_64-v3 to x86_64-v2.

SUSE is currently looking into providing support for x86_64-v3 and perhaps even v4 through hwcaps functionality, just as it is currently being handled on other non-intel architectures. 

Dimstar already announced that openSUSE Factory will lead the way and set the minimum architecture level for Intel to x86_64-v2 in upcoming weeks.

Those who have older hardware than x86_64-v2 can still install the 32bit Intel variant of openSUSE Tumbleweed. We have you covered!
