openSUSE Leap 15.5 was released earlier this week and [release team](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Release_team) would like to hear from you about your experience with openSUSE Leap 15.5.

Did anything go particularly well, or perhaps did we miss something? Did you have trouble downloading, installing, or contributing to Leap 15.5? Did you like the overall communication?

Simply head to [survey.opensuse.org](https://survey.opensuse.org/index.php?r=survey/index&sid=129923&lang=en) and tell us.

## About the survey

The survey is anonymous and has only two questions *"What went well?* and *"What didn't go too well?"*. 
 
[Leap 15.5 release retrospective survey](https://survey.opensuse.org/index.php?r=survey/index&sid=129923&lang=en) will remain open for two weeks from the release, until 21st June.

We're using our own instance of [LimeSurvey](https://www.limesurvey.org/) as the platform.

## How will the data be used?

Past that, we'll announce a few rounds of public review meetings, where we'll review and categorize feedback (see feedback from previous releases) and will try to come up with action items to address issues.<br />

## Opportunity to recognize teams or individuals

If you'd like to **recognize some of the contributors** please do so! We'll use it as input for release recognition e-thank-you emails.
Both teams or individuals will be happy to see that you appreciate their efforts!

Everybody is welcome to help us with the recognition effort feel free to participate on [Github](https://github.com/openSUSE/artwork/pull/72).
