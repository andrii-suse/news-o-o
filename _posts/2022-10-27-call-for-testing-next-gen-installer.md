Members of the [openSUSE Project's](https://www.opensuse.org/) release team are asking community to help the [YaST team](https://yast.opensuse.org/blog) with early testing of [the installer images](https://build.opensuse.org/package/binaries/YaST:Head:D-Installer/d-installer-live/images).

The installer is progressing its way to [openSUSE Factory](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Factory) and will arrive in an Adaptable Linux Platform [prototype](https://news.opensuse.org/2022/09/26/alp-les-droites/) at a later date.  

The installer, which is reffered to as the D-Installer by the YaST team, has [installer images](https://build.opensuse.org/package/binaries/YaST:Head:D-Installer/d-installer-live/images) for testing and is seeking input/feedback through a [feedback guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AGKijKpKiJCB616-bHVoNQuhWHpQLHPWCb3m1p6gXPc/edit?usp=sharing). 

There are several sets of instructions in the guide that is meant to elicit feedback on the next generation installer.

The team is also looking to rename the D-Installer to another name and an [openSUSE Tweet](https://twitter.com/openSUSE/status/1584923604252299265?s=20&t=lGGo_2ufSJeqiNwSULiPWQ) asks people to suggest a new name. The D-Installer visually checks the installation settings at a glance and is one of the key areas that the release team would like the community to focus on during the next weeks.

An installer workshop is scheduled during a community meeting on Nov. 8. People can use this [feedback guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AGKijKpKiJCB616-bHVoNQuhWHpQLHPWCb3m1p6gXPc/edit?usp=sharing) to test items for the next installer and provide feedback in the [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AGKijKpKiJCB616-bHVoNQuhWHpQLHPWCb3m1p6gXPc/edit?usp=sharing) or during the workshop.

The [github page](https://github.com/yast/d-installer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) for the installer has a few listed issues and people can also contribute and provide feedback there.

The current ALP prototype only has [x86-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64).
