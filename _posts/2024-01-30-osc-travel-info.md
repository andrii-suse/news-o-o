The [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC24) in Nuremberg, Germany, at the end of June may feel like a long time away, but if you are planning to oSC24, there are topics that need action now before timelines become too short. 

Getting a visa may take some time. There are certain requirements necessary to receive a visa for those who are not citizens of a Schengen country. You may need a formal invitation letter that fully explains the nature of your visit. 

An overview of visa requirements/exemptions for entry into the Federal Republic of Germany can be found at the [Federal Foreign Office website](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/einreiseundaufenthalt/visabestimmungen-node/staatenlistevisumpflicht-node). You must apply for a Schengen visa through the German embassy or consulate in your country. 

If you plan to attend the conference and are coming from a country where you will need a formal invitation letter, email ddemaio(at)opensuse.org with the email subject “oSC24 Visa”.

Also important to consider is the [Travel Support Program](https://tsp.opensuse.org/). People who want to use the TSP for this year's openSUSE Conference must read the [How to Apply](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Travel_Support_Program#How_to_apply_for_Travel_sponsorship) section and follow the appropriate steps. The TSP is now being done by the [Geeko Foundation](https://geekos.org/), so be aware that some new procedures and certain limitations apply. Read the [info on the wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Travel_Support_Program#How_to_apply_for_Travel_sponsorship) and use [tsp.opensuse.org](https://tsp.opensuse.org/) to apply. Requests will be accepted until May 10. The TSP is a helpful way to get people in the community to attend the conference. Funding is limited, but help to support the community’s attendance. 

Here are a few reminders regarding the TSP:
