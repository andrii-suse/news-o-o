The [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC23) did not slow down [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/) [Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) snapshots from frequently being released this week.

Three snapshots have been released since last Friday when the conference began and a new major version of [QEMU](https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/8.0) arrived just days after the conference.

This emulator and virtualizer arrived in snapshot [20230530](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/TZRO6PHQQ6CAQO4GTT7PFUUQPBKFY6K6/). The update of [qemu 8.0](https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/8.0) fixed dependencies and improved the [spec file](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Specfile_guidelines); the package added support for [Xen](https://xenproject.org/) guests under [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) with [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) version above 5.12. Two newly emulated CPU types were [arm](https://www.arm.com/)â€™s [Cortex-A55](https://developer.arm.com/Processors/Cortex-A55) and [Cortex-R52](https://developer.arm.com/Processors/Cortex-R52). [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) also had some support extensions added with the emulator, and [s390x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/390) improved device handling and fixed some emulation instructions with the major version package update. [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/)  had an update. The 23.1.2 version of [python-pip](https://pypi.org/) upgraded [setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/) to 67.7.2 and added a `--keyring-provider` flag. An old [Common Vulnerability and Exposure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures) was fixed with the [python310](https://www.python.org/) 3.10.11 update. [CVE-2007-4559](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-4559) that could allow for user-assisted remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files was fixed and the language package  also fixed a bug that caused a crash when deallocating deeply nested filter objects. Another package to update in the snapshot was [Btrfs](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org) 6.3. The file system added a patch, removed some old files and provided some integration with [GitHub](https://github.com/) actions. A few [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) packages were updated in the snapshot. Several fixes were made with [gnome-software](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-software) 44.2 like fixing a bug with listing [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) addons when multiple [Flathub](https://flathub.org/) remotes are enabled. Extensible screen reader [Orca](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Orca) updated to version 44.1 and improves performance by checking for duplicate object events. The 44.2 version of the [gnome-control-center](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center) had fixes in [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) template usage that caused crashes on some systems.

The snapshot that arrived the day before was [20230529](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/XA7IOHYH5RWCQ3V77XR3U3NAVRCEWFKE/). This updated the [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/); with the [kernel-source](https://www.kernel.org/) 6.3.4, fixes were made in different areas like networking, scsi, netfilter, bonding, and more. An update of [grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) 3.11 fixed a pattern matching issue with the `-P` option. Patterns like `[\d]` now work again, which was broken in the previous version. Multiple CVEs associated with Chromium were fixed in [ libqt5-qtwebengine 5.15.14](https://software.opensuse.org/package/libqt5-qtwebengine); these included a stack buffer overflow, heap buffer overflow, an out-of-bounds memory access, and other vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by attackers to compromise the system.

An update of [gstreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) 1.22.3 fixed a video decoder deadlock with [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) 6 as well as some regression handling of input streams. The pixel encoder [babl](https://gegl.org/babl/) 0.1.106 has a faster startup by caching balanced RGB to XYZ matrices. Several other packages updated in the snapshot including window manager [icewm](https://ice-wm.org/) 3.3.5, [diffutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/) 3.10, [xfce4-panel](https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-panel/start) 4.18.4 and [crypto-policies](https://github.com/linux-system-roles/crypto_policies).

The [20230526](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/LQTCXUPS4BMCIHXBAUKEWVN47DUNV3BQ/) snapshot had eight packages update. [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) 7.1.1.10 was among the packages to update and it fixed security vulnerability [CVE-2023-2157](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-2157.html). [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org) 113.0.2 fixed a bug causing it to freeze on certain pages with the Developer Tools Web Console open. There was also a bug fixed related to the vertical resizing of the bookmark and history sidebars. Programming language [guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/) updated to version 3.0.9 and introduced a new interface, functionality and refreshed some patches. An update of [libreoffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) 7.5.3.2 also refreshed some patches and fixed a Microsoft PPTX format issue. Translations for Georgian using [Weblate](https://weblate.org/) were made in the [libstorage-ng](https://github.com/openSUSE/libstorage-ng) 4.5.110 update. Two CVEs were fixed in the snapshot as well; [mariadb](https://mariadb.org/) 10.11.3 took care of [CVE-2022-47015](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-47015.html), which had a Denial of Service vulnerability for MariaDB Servers in versions 10.3.34 thru 10.9.3, and an updated 4.17.1 version of [xen](https://xenproject.org/) took care of [CVE-2022-42336](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-42336.html), which had a security vulnerability on [AMD](https://www.amd.com) hardware specific to the AMD Family 17h and Hygon Family 18h processors.
