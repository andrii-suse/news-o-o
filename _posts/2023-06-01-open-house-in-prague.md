Members of the [Geekos](https://geekos.org/) community are inviting technology enthusiasts, students, potential candidates, and anyone interested in open source, [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) and Linux to an Open House event in [SUSE](https://www.suse.com/)’s Prague office on June 7 from 5 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.

The purpose of the event is to provide attendees with an exclusive opportunity to gain insight into open-source companies like SUSE and projects like openSUSE; organizers aim to share the unique culture of the two, and exhibit the exceptional work being done by the organizations. Participants will have the chance to interact with SUSE employees and openSUSE members as well as explore the office space, and learn more about the innovative projects being developed.

"The SUSE Open House is an excellent platform for us to showcase our company, culture, and the amazing work happening here in Prague," said Kristyna Streitova, one of the main organizers of the event. "We are excited to welcome everyone, whether they are students, potential candidates, family and friends, or former colleagues. This event is for everyone who has an interest in SUSE, openSUSE, or Linux."

The event schedule and additional details can be found on the official website at https://more.suse.com/openhousecz. Participants are encouraged to join the conversation on the official Telegram channel at https://t.me/SUSEOpenHouseCZChat.

To ensure the success of the Open House, organizers are seeking the support of the community. Attendees are encouraged to help promote the event by sharing posts about it on social media and inviting friends, family, and colleagues who may be interested. 

One of the highlights of the Open House will be team presentations, allowing attendees to gain insights into various departments and projects. The Open House will feature a tour allowing visitors to explore the infrastructure that powers the organizations’ cutting-edge solutions.

"We encourage everyone to come to the office on Wednesday and be a part of this exciting event,” Streitova said. “We want to create a vibrant atmosphere and show our passion for open source technology.”

The Open House promises to be an engaging and informative event that provides attendees with a unique opportunity to connect with a vibrant community and learn about the latest innovations and career opportunities.
