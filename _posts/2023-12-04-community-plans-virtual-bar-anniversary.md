The ways communities connect and interact have also transformed over the year. 

Amidst a time where people saw every square inch/cm of their homes, [two openSUSE members](https://youtu.be/YmnawYltDSQ?si=ioXDFhTtpgeN8IEI) founded an innovative way to foster camaraderie and engagement among its community; through a [virtual bar](https://youtu.be/YmnawYltDSQ?si=ioXDFhTtpgeN8IEI). 

What began as an idea to bridge distances and create a welcoming space for enthusiasts has now blossomed into a three-year tradition, marking its anniversary.

When the world was navigating the uncharted waters of remote interactions in 2020, the openSUSE community took a bold step to launch its virtual bar at [meet.opensuse.org/bar](https://meet.opensuse.org/bar). 

Aimed to emulate the lively atmosphere of a physical bar where individuals gather, chat, share knowledge, stories and, most importantly, bond over their passion for openSUSE and Linux. It even has a [Telegram](https://t.me/opensuse_bar_group) group to let people know when the bar is open.

From its inception on December 19, 2020, this virtual watering hole serves as a hub for both seasoned veterans and newcomers. People on the platform share insights, troubleshoot technical issues, discuss the latest developments in the world of Linux, and build lasting connections over drinks of their choice that transcend geographical boundaries. 

The success of the openSUSE virtual bar lies not just in its technical infrastructure but in its vibrant community. 

The community gears up to celebrate its third anniversary on December 19, 2023, starting at noon UTC time. 

The virtual bar has become more than just a place for technical discussions; it has evolved into a support network where members find encouragement, mentorship, and a sense of belonging. Newcomers, in particular, have found solace in the welcoming environment and are actively participating in the openSUSE Community.

Raise your virtual glasses and join the openSUSE community in commemorating three years of friendship, learning, and camaraderie at the [virtual bar](https://meet.opensuse.org/bar).
