Users of openSUSE Leap 15.2 will not be receiving security and maintenance updates as the version is now EOL (end of life) as of Jan. 4, 2022.

EOL ends updates for the operating system minor version. Those who continue to use EOL versions will be exposed to vulnerabilities because these discontinued versions no longer receive security and maintenance updates. This is why users need to upgrade to the newer minor release; openSUSE Leap 15.3!

Users can upgrade from 15.2 to 15.3 by downloading the iso image or following the instructions on how to upgrade found on <https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:System_upgrade>.

For new installations, download openSUSE Leap 15.3 images at <https://get.opensuse.org/leap/>. The Leap 15.3 release is supported with security patches and updates and is expected to reach its EOL in November 2022. Leap 15.4 is expected to be released in June 2022, according to the [roadmap](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Roadmap).

Users interested in changing from the point release version to the rolling version can move to Tumbleweed, which provides large daily and frequent updates of all software in the official repositories.

Download it from [here](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) and the best way to do the change is to reinstall your system, so take a backup of your /home directory and any configuration files you want to save ( f.e. /etc /var ).
