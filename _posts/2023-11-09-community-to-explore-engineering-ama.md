The open-source community is in for a treat next week as an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session on the [openSUSE Project’s Jitsi](https://meet.opensuse.org/) instance will provide unique and insightful information about how Quality Engineering teams work.

The AMA is scheduled for November 16 at 19:00 UTC and will take place online at [meet.opensuse.org/meeting](https://meet.opensuse.org/meeting). 

Santiago Zarate, who is a Product Owner of SUSE’s Quality Engineering Core team, will run the session organized during [Hack Week](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/23/projects/run-ama-outside-of-suse-engineering).

The AMA session aims to provide a closer look at how developers in the Research and Development (R&D) sector of SUSE work. The primary goal is to foster collaboration and understanding between Global Services and Infrastructure (GSI) and Engineering, which will help to unravel the intricacies of development workflows and shed some light on Quality Engineering practices.

The objective of the session is clear; give the audience a window into the inner workings of SUSE Engineering, offering people an opportunity to ask questions and gain insights into the processes behind the scenes. 

Attendees are encouraged to submit their questions beforehand at https://etherpad.opensuse.org/p/ama to ensure a vibrant and engaging discussion during the live AMA.

While the AMA offers a limited window into SUSE Engineering for open-source attendees, it serves as a valuable platform to enhance the collective understanding of the organization's processes.

The AMA session is not just an opportunity to ask questions, but also a chance to foster collaboration, bridge gaps, and gain a deeper understanding of the intricate processes that drive engineering efforts. Don't miss out on this unique chance to connect with like minded software engineers. 

Mark your calendars for November 16 at 19:00 UTC, and join the conversation on meet.opensuse.org/meeting. The community’s regular weekly meeting is scheduled to follow the AMA at 20:00 UTC, but the time for the community meeting can be used to extend the AMA.
