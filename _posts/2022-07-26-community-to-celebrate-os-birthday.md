The [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) Project is preparing to celebrate its 17th Birthday on August 9.

The project will have a 24-hour social event with attendees visiting openSUSE’s virtual Bar. 

Commonly referred to as the [openSUSE Bar](https://meet.opensuse.org/bar) or slash bar [(/bar)](https://meet.opensuse.org/bar), openSUSE's [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) instance has become a frequent virtual hang out with regulars and newcomers. 

People who like or use [openSUSE distributions](https://get.opensuse.org/) and tools are welcome to visit, hang out and chat with other attendees during the celebration.

This special 24-hour celebration has no last call and will have music and other social activities like playing a special openSUSE [skribble.io](https://skribble.io) edition; it’s a game where people draw and guess openSUSE and open source themed topics. 

People can find the openSUSE Bar at <https://meet.opensuse.org/bar>. 

There will be an Adaptable Linux Platform (ALP) Work Group (WG) [feedback session](https://etherpad.opensuse.org/p/weeklymeeting20220809) on openSUSE’s Birthday on August 9 at 14:30 UTC taking place on <https://meet.opensuse.org/meeting>. The session follows an [install workshop](https://news.opensuse.org/2022/08/03/wg-shifts-to-feedback/) from August 2 that went over installing [MicroOS Desktop](https://get.opensuse.org/microos/). The session is designed to gain feedback on how people use their Operating System to help progress ALP development.

The openSUSE Project came into existence on August 9, 2005. An [email](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/users@lists.opensuse.org/thread/T3SJWQDKZS635EHR5SX2AY3Z3LZAVNX5/) about the launch of a community-based Linux distribution was sent out on August 3 and the announcement was made during LinuxWorld in San Francisco, which was at the Moscone Convention Center from August 8 to 11, 2005. The email processing the launch discussed upgrading to KDE 3.4.2 on SuSE 9.3.
