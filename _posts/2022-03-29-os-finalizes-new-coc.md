The [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/) Community is proud to announce its new Code of Conduct as approved by the [openSUSE Board](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board). 

The openSUSE [Code of Conduct](https://en.opensuse.org/Code_of_Conduct) was written during [several community meetings](https://etherpad.opensuse.org/p/weeklymeeting) as a collaborative project and reports were sent to the project [mailinglists](https://lists.opensuse.org/). The input from the openSUSE community members was sent to the openSUSE Board and discussed at length during two public [openSUSE Board meetings](https://code.opensuse.org/board/tickets/issues).

During the February 28, 2022, public Board Meeting, it was recognized that openSUSE did not have an adequate Code of Conduct; as such, the board asked if any attendees were willing to take the initiave to work with the community to develop one. Through the [regulary scheduled community meetings](https://etherpad.opensuse.org/p/weeklymeeting), one was written, and subsequently proposed to the Board.

We hope that by having a clear and concise Code of Conduct for the project that the openSUSE Community can continue to grow and prosper in the years to come.

The openSUSE Code of Conduct can be found at [https://en.opensuse.org/Code_of_Conduct](https://en.opensuse.org/Code_of_Conduct).
