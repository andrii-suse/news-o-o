People interested in [mentorship](https://101.opensuse.org/) for this year’s [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) as part of [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)’s application will conclude a finalization meetup on Feb. 7 at 15:30 UTC on the project’s [Jitsi instance](https://meet.opensuse.org/meeting) channel. 

After the project meeting, the project will submit an application for the openSUSE Project being a mentorship organization for 2023.

A large group of people involved in the project participated in a [workshop on Jan. 10](https://news.opensuse.org/2022/12/14/project-plans-workshop-to-grow-mentorship-efforts/) with a focus on increasing mentorship for the organization and listing project mentoring ideas. Participants brainstormed project ideas during the workshop on [the event’s etherpad](https://etherpad.opensuse.org/p/GSoC2023WS) and created listings for the project’s [mentorship repository](https://github.com/openSUSE/mentoring/issues). 

Still, there is plenty of time for people who are interested in mentoring to [create an issue on the mentorship repository](https://github.com/openSUSE/mentoring/issues); the submitter of the issue will be listed as the main mentor. Those who do submit a project idea should list all the details from the template and label it with a tag as either a large-size project (350 hrs) or medium-size project (175 hrs).

Those who did not attend the workshop are still encouraged to participate as a mentor if they have the time or interest. The mentorship efforts have proven over the years to introduce people into open-source development, the many projects openSUSE has and the interactions it has with many other open-source projects. The openSUSE Project lists it’s GSoC mentorship projects on [101.opensuse.org](https://101.opensuse.org/).

The openSUSE Project has a long tradition of participating in GSoC and has done it several times since 2006. If you have any questions about the GSoC application or want to help mentor a project on [101.opensuse.org](https://101.opensuse.org/), email ddemaio@opensuse.org. The application period is open between Jan. 23 and Feb 7, but mentors can add their project on [101.opensuse.org](https://101.opensuse.org/) now.
