Happy 18th Birthday to openSUSE! It's that time of the year once again where we will raise our virtual glasses and celebrate the remarkable journey of open-source innovation. 

On August 9th, 2005, an [announcement was made during the LinuxWorld Conference & Expo](https://www.tech-insider.org/linux/research/2005/0809.html) in San Francisco, giving birth to what we now know as the [openSUSE Project](https://www.opensuse.org/). 

The now defunct company known as [Novell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell) unveiled openSUSE to the technology world with excitement. Riding on the heels of the success of Red Hat's announcement of [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/), it was natural for Novell to embrace the open-source movement and introduce its own community-driven Linux distribution.

The journey of openSUSE officially began with the release of beta versions of [SUSE Linux 10.0](https://en.opensuse.org/Archive:SUSE_Linux_10.0) under the banner of openSUSE.org. The first official release under the openSUSE name was [10.2](https://en.opensuse.org/Archive:OpenSUSE_10.2).

As we celebrate 18 years of openSUSE, it's an opportune moment to reflect on the incredible journey this project has undertaken. Here we are years later and openSUSE stands strong with a lot of experiences endured by the community and its main sponsor [SUSE](https://www.suse.com/). SUSE joined Novell in 2003, which broadened its horizons and influence. Six years later Novell made the announcement of the openSUSE Project there was an acquisition of SUSE by [The Attachmate Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Attachmate_Group), which was later integrated into [Micro Focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Focus) in 2014; this point in time showcased SUSE's resilience. [EQT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EQT_Partners) added a unique touch in 2018 with the purchase of SUSE. In 2021, SUSE's public debut on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange highlighted its dynamic evolution and enduring voyage as an open-source company.

To celebrate the project’s 18th Birthday, consider joining [openSUSE’s virtual bar](https://meet.opensuse.org/bar), where open-source enthusiasts from across the globe can gather to celebrate, connect, and share their passion for openSUSE. Known as slash bar (/bar), the virtual doors to meet others with a similar passion remain open. Join in or listen to the [openSUSE bar’s playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1dhXTdUuWYfpwmGVxJPUxW?si=82f2cbef617548d3) on Spotify. 

As the world evolves, so does openSUSE, and we hope you celebrate along with us for turning 18. Let's toast to 18 years of open-source excellence and look forward to the exciting chapters that lie ahead. Happy 18th Birthday, openSUSE! Here's to the journey and the future!
