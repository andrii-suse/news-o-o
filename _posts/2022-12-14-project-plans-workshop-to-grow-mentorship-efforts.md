The [openSUSE Project](https://www.opensuse.org/) will have a workshop on Jan. 10 at 15:30 UTC at [meet.opensuse.org/meeting](https://meet.opensuse.org/meeting) that will focus on increasing mentorship for this year’s [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

There is a long tradition of the openSUSE Project participating in the GSoC and community members that want to participate as either a mentor or mentee are encouraged to attend.

The workshop gives attendees a chance to generate project ideas and list them on [101.opensuse.org](https://101.opensuse.org/) for this year’s application, which is open between Jan. 23 and Feb 7. 

The workshop will give mentors, mentees and people who would like to get involved with mentoring enough time to describe several project ideas before the administrators submit the GSoC application.

Participants are encouraged to create an outline of some project ideas before the workshop on [the event’s etherpad](https://etherpad.opensuse.org/p/GSoC2023WS).

Mentors, mentees and administrators who participated in previous Google Summer of Code programs will attend the workshop.
