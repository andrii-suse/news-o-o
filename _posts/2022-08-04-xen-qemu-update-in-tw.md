The [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/) [Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) produced five snapshots since last Thursday that have so far been released.

Among some of the packages updated this week besides those listed above in the headline were [curl](https://curl.se/), [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), [fetchmail](https://www.fetchmail.info/), [vim](https://www.vim.org/) and more.

Snapshot [20220802](http://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/opensuse/tumbleweed/iso/Changes.20220802.txt) was released a couple hours ago and updated just four packages. The update of [webkit2gtk3](https://webkitgtk.org/) 2.36.5 fixed video playback for the Yelp browser. It and webkit2gtk3-soup2 also fixed a couple [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposure). An update of [yast2-trans](https://software.opensuse.org/package/yast2-trans) provided some Slovak translations. 

The update of [xen](https://xenproject.org/) 4.16.1_06 arrived in snapshot [20220801](http://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/opensuse/tumbleweed/iso/Changes.20220801.txt) and it offered several patches. One of those was a fix for a [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/) 13 compilation error and xen also addressed a [CVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposure); [CVE-2022-33745](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-33745.html) had a wrong use of a variable due to a code move and lead to a wrong [TLB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_lookaside_buffer) flush condition. Another of the packages to arrive in the snapshot was an update of [fetchmail](https://www.fetchmail.info/) 6.4.32; the package updated translations and added a patch to clean up some scripts. Many changes were made in the [mozilla-nss](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/security/nss/index.html) 3.80 update, which added a few certificates and support for asynchronous client auth hooks. The package also removed the [Hellenic Academic 2011 root certificate](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1759815). Terminal multiplexer, [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux), updated to 3.3a and added [systemd](https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) socket activation support, which can be built with `-enable-systemd`.

An update of [kdump](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kdump/kdump.html) fixed a network-related [dracut](https://dracut.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) handling for [Firmware Assisted Dump](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/powerpc/firmware-assisted-dump.html). An update of [codec2](https://github.com/drowe67/codec2) version 1.0.5 fixed a [FreeDV](https://freedv.org/) [Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) backward compatibility issue in the previous minor version. An update of [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) 1.2.1 fixes five crashes, more than 25 bugs and improved 15 user-interface translations.
