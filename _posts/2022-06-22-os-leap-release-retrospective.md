We are seeking feedback regarding the release of [openSUSE Leap 15.4](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/15.4/), which was released to the general public on June 8.

With this survey, what we're looking from you is both positive and negative feedback related to the availability and individual experience with openSUSE Leap 15.4. Your participation is very valuable for us.

Participating is very simple, this survey consists of only two questions, in this way we'll try to continue doing what went well and try to address what went wrong. So follow this link to partipate in this survey:

* [https://survey.opensuse.org/](https://survey.opensuse.org/)

The deadline for collecting responses is **July 7**. Your responses will be then grouped and reviewed and passed to the respective openSUSE teams.

[Here](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:15.3/Retrospective) you can find the results from previous retrospective.

We care about your privacy, that's why the record of your survey responses does not contain any identifying information about you, unless a specific survey question explicitly asked for it. Feedback might be adjusted to fit our report.

Thanks a lot for being part of [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) community.
