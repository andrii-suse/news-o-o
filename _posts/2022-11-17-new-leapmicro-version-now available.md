The [openSUSE Project](https://www.opensuse.org/) is pleased to announce the release of its modern lightweight host operating system [Leap Micro 5.3](https://get.opensuse.org/leapmicro).

This release has a new [SELinux](https://github.com/SELinuxProject) module for [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/) that provides basic functionality for users to troubleshoot configurations and makes [NetworkManager](https://networkmanager.dev/) the default network configuration tool.

This  release is based on SUSE Linux Enterprise SUSE [(SLE) Micro](https://www.suse.com/download/sle-micro/) 5.3 and is built on top of a [SLE 15 Service Pack 4](https://www.suse.com/releasenotes/x86_64/SUSE-SLES/15-SP4/index.html) update.

This ultra-reliable, lightweight and immutable operating system can be used for several compute environments like edge, embedded, IoT deployments and others.

The host-OS has automated administration and patching, so auto-updating gives users a persistent bootable system for their container and virtualized workloads.

Users should know that [zypper](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Zypper_usage) is not used with Leap Micro, but [transactional-update](https://opensuse.github.io/openSUSE-docs-revamped-temp/microos_getting_started/#transcational-update-default) is used instead. One of the packages related to Leap Micro for developers is [Podman](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES.md#342). Podman gives developers options to run their applications with Podman in production.

[Leap Micro](https://get.opensuse.org/leapmicro/5.3/) has similarities of [MicroOS](https://get.opensuse.org/microos/), but [Leap Micro](https://get.opensuse.org/leapmicro/) does not offer a graphical user interface or desktop version. However, users can use [Cockpit to manage their host OS through a web browser](https://youtu.be/uf5C5OMscDk). 

Large development teams can add value to their operations by trying Leap Micro and transitioning to SUSEâ€™s [SLE Micro](https://www.suse.com/download/sle-micro/) for extended maintenance and certification.

Developers and professionals can build and scale systems for use in aerospace, telecommunications, automotive, defense, healthcare, hospitality, manufacturing, database, web server, robotics, blockchain and more.
