This week [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/) [Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) has been on a constant roll as consecutive snapshots arrive with fresh software updates.

[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/), [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) and [gnome-software](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-software) were part of a range of updates introduced this week, in addition to the ones highlighted in the headline.

Just two packages updated in snapshot [20231206](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/WZ2H7OOQFO3IQCZIOXZYBOFMI5F7YW5M/). The Chinese lunar date library [lunar-date](https://github.com/yetist/lunar-date) has a new major version with the 3.0.1 update; it introduces a localized interface and changes the project option names. The package also updates its license as it has been changed to [LGPL-2.1](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html). The update of the [rubygem-rubocop](https://rubygems.org/gems/rubocop/versions/1.58.0?locale=en) 1.58.0 package resolves issues like false negatives for various styles, improves some code quality and ensures more accurate autocorrections for different code patterns. The 1.58.0 [rubygem-rubocop](https://rubygems.org/gems/rubocop/versions/1.58.0?locale=en) version was also updated in the [Arm Tumbleweed 20231206 snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/arm@lists.opensuse.org/thread/KE3W6G52JOKMQX5LRTK3QAHPXO265EY3/). 

An update of snapshot  [gnome-shell](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell) 45.2 became available in snapshot [20231205](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/YZ2Z4INOG44QZIYHZMFNVKSHTQPV5YJW/). The release addresses several performance issues, improves [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/)â€™s application search function, and fixes bugs related to the on-screen keyboard. The update improves high-contrast styling, fixes tablet ring and strip mapping, addresses some crashes and updates translations. There were bug fixes that caused unnecessary reloading of the trip query with [gnome-maps](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-maps) 45.2. Various enhancements were made with the [fwupd](https://fwupd.org/)  1.9.10 update along with bug fixes. Notable additions were support for `not_hardware` requirements and [loongarch64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loongson) microprocessors. The update improves USB claim retry count configuration, enforces version requirements, hides sensitive information in debugging logs, and refines device-specific functionalities, such as [Wacom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacom) USB device emulation. An update of [sudo](https://www.sudo.ws/) 1.9.15p2 addresses `sudo -l command` warning messages, enhances security against [rowhammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer) attacks, and makes improvements to log messages for better user understanding and system security. An 123 version update of the application development toolkit for controlling system-wide privileges, [polkit](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/polkit/polkit) introduces enhanced safety measures, such as deeper restrictions on configuration files, owner restriction for the daemon under [systemd](https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/), and improves sandboxing within systemd units with the aim to better system security. An update of [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) 3.44.2 rectifies issues such as [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) mistakes, Full-Text Search (FTS5) problems identified during internal testing and compiler warnings in debug builds with [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/) 16. The snapshot had updates for [hwdata](https://github.com/vcrhonek/hwdata) 0.377, [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses) 6.4.20231202 and more. Many of the same packages updated in the [Arm Tumbleweed 20231205 snapshot](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/arm@lists.opensuse.org/thread/FT5LBZ5TCBG7EJACWCQTJ7KM2IBN2LHA/).

Several [Qt 6](https://www.qt.io/product/qt6) subpackages updated in snapshot [20231204](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/3FNXUM7I2UZVQNJVDHUW6YOCUVVZIB6T/).  The 6.6.1 version of [qt6-base](https://www.qt.io/)  fixes `QMenuBar` functionality limitations and corrects errors related to `QFont`'s feature [Application Programming Interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). The update of [qt6-wayland](https://www.qt.io/) 6.6.1 fixes crashes related to texture orphanage and fixes issues with drag and drop with a [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) display. An update of [ibus](https://github.com/ibus/ibus) 1.5.29 enhances Continuous Integration (CI), adds signals to` PostProcessKeyEvent`, which prevents a tab from being committed by the Input Method and fixes key typing, Emoji, and Unicode issues. The [libguestfs](https://www.libguestfs.org/) 1.51.8 package, which is a tool for accessing and modifying virtual machine (VM) disk images, adds a `--chown` option for `virt-customize` and a new `--tar-in` operation. A few other packages were updated in the snapshot.

An update of snapshot [llvm17](https://llvm.org/) 17.0.6 landed in snapshot [20231203](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/IAJ2F5ZKXLLGKBL5227TGVRTMHHM3DBD/). The update for the compiler and toolchain package includes rebase patches, adjustments to the versioned executables for better support, and standardizes the management of `clang-cpp` using `update-alternatives` akin to other binaries for smoother operation. The 11.1.2 version of [mariadb](https://mariadb.org/) includes several fixes related to unwanted binary locations, memory constraints on [ppc64le](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ppc64) and skipped tests. An update of the a calendar widget for Chinese lunar library [lunar-calendar](https://github.com/yetist/lunar-calendar) 3.0.1 involves a modification of the license that transitions to [LGPL-2.1](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html) from the previous licensing terms.

An update of [gnome-software](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-software) 45.2 came in snapshot [20231202](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/5FTRUNXH23ZWKX37LVEZIWTBB5O3W4W5/) and primarily focuses on translations updates for multiple languages, according to the changelog. An older [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/) had a [git](https://github.com/git) update with [gcc13](https://gcc.gnu.org/) 13.2.1+git8109. It had fix for building [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) on [i686 systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P6_(microarchitecture)) and implements changes related to [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) dependency. An update of [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) 1.3.2 addresses a data loss issue and corrects a saving error related to some shapes and 3D boxes. The app for organizing personal data and scheduling, [evolution](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evolution), updates to version 3.50.2 and fixes a crash and a [memory leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak); it also fixes an issue with the search functionality. The [gtk4](https://www.gtk.org/) 4.12.4 update improves accessibility name computation, fixes memory format table errors, updated translations and makes some additional refinements.

The snapshot starting off the week was [20231201](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/K2BJRCMU6NM3B5ZQTSDJ5UV7LM6RUMOT/). An update of [perl](https://www.perl.org/) 5.38.2 fixes two [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures). One of those was [CVE-2023-47038](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-47038.html), which occurs when a crafted regular expression is compiled by perl. The other was [CVE-2023-47039](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-47039.html). [Snapper](https://github.com/openSUSE/snapper)  0.10.7 addresses issues related to diff for [Logical Volume Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_volume_management)-based configs and `SystemCmd` accepting a collection of strings. An update of [iproute2](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/iproute2/iproute2.git) 6.6 removes several features and adds backup support in the bridge along with adjustments for the security protocol suite.
