The [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC23) is set to begin in 100 days from today and, to help prepare people who want to travel to Nuremberg for the event from May 26 - 28, there is information people attending need to know. 

Getting a visa may take some time. There are certain requirements necessary to receive a visa for those who are not a citizen of a Schengen country. You may need a formal invitation letter that fully explains the nature of your visit. 

An overview of visa requirements/exemptions for entry into the Federal Republic of Germany can be found at the [Federal Foreign Office website](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/einreiseundaufenthalt/visabestimmungen-node/staatenlistevisumpflicht-node). You must apply for a Schengen visa through the German embassy or consulate in your country. 

If you plan to attend the conference and are coming from a country where you will need a formal invitation letter, email ddemaio@ opensuse.org with the email subject “oSC23 Visa”.
