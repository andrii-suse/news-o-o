As of today, [nodejs14](https://software.opensuse.org/package/nodejs14) as well as any older nodejs versions will no longer receive updates in [openSUSE Leap 15.4](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/15.4/). 

Users are adviced to switch to [nodejs16](https://software.opensuse.org/package/nodejs16) instead. The [nodejs16](https://software.opensuse.org/package/nodejs16) version is an official package in Leap 15.4 despite [software.opensuse.org](https://software.opensuse.org) not visibly showing the tag. There is a issue filed to fix that on the website.
