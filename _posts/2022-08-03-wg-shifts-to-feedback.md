Members of [openSUSE’s](https://www.opensuse.org/) Adaptable Linux Platform (ALP) community workgroup had a successful [install workshop on August 2](https://news.opensuse.org/2022/07/27/microos-install-workshop-feedback-sessions-planned/) and are transitioning to two install feedback sessions.

The first feedback session is scheduled to take place on [openSUSE’s Birthday](https://news.opensuse.org/2022/07/26/community-to-celebrate-os-birthday/) on August 9 at 14:30 UTC. The second feedback session is scheduled to take place on August 11 during the [community meeting](https://etherpad.opensuse.org/p/weeklymeeting) at 19:00 UTC.

Attendees of the workshop were asked to install [MicroOS Desktop](https://get.opensuse.org/microos/) and temporarily use it. This is being done to gain some feedback on how people use their Operating System, which allows the work groups to develop a frame of reference for how ALP can progress.

The [call for people to test spin MicroOS Desktop](https://news.opensuse.org/2022/07/19/microos-desktop-use-to-help-with-alp-feedback/) has received a lot of feedback and the workshop also provided a lot of feedback. One of the comments in the virtual feedback session was "stable base + fresh apps? sign me up".

### *“stable base + fresh apps? sign me up.” - listed in comments during workshop*

Two install videos were posted to the [openSUSETV YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/openSUSE) to help get people started with installing and testing MicroOS.

The video [Installing Workshop Video (MicroOS Desktop)](https://youtu.be/--hoHcNjWgE) went over the expectations for ALP and then discussed experiences going through a testing [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AGKijKpKiJCB616-bHVoNQuhWHpQLHPWCb3m1p6gXPc/edit?usp=sharing).

The other video, which was not shown during the workshop due to time limitations, was called [Installing MicroOS on a Raspberry Pi 400](https://youtu.be/EY5-fYb8wGQ) and gave an overview on how to get MicroOS Desktop with a graphical interface running on the Raspberry Pi.

A final Lucid Presentation is scheduled for August 16 during the regularly scheduled workgroup. 

People are encouraged to send feedback to the [ALP-community-wg mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/alp-community-wg@lists.opensuse.org/) and to attend the feedback sessions, which will be listed in the [community meeting](https://etherpad.opensuse.org/p/weeklymeeting) notes.

Users can download the MicroOS Desktop at <https://get.opensuse.org/microos/> and see instructions and record comments on the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AGKijKpKiJCB616-bHVoNQuhWHpQLHPWCb3m1p6gXPc/edit?usp=sharing).
