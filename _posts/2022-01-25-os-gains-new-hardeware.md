The [openSUSE Project](https://www.opensuse.org/) added an enormous amount of compute power for its projects this past year thanks to [SUSE,](https://www.suse.com/) which is the project's main sponsor. The added hardware will help with [open-source development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_development).

The project now uses around a thousand build workers for [x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86), which will help with creating and distributing software for major Linux distributions in the [Open Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/).

Multiple other architectures were added to [OBS](https://build.opensuse.org/); a few months ago, the project added five new [POWER9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POWER9) machines, which are valued at roughly $80,000 per machine. The additional machines will put [PowerPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC) back to a level consistent with the build power of [OBS](https://build.opensuse.org/)' [arm](https://www.arm.com/) machines. PowerPC wasn't the only [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/) addition to [OBS](https://build.opensuse.org/). In August, the project added an additional mainframe; an [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/) [LinuxONE System](https://www.ibm.com/partnerworld/systems/z/linuxone) was added as loaner hardware. Matched with a [z13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_zEnterprise_System "IBM zEnterprise System") [mainframe computer,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer) this gives [OBS](https://build.opensuse.org/)  extensive build power for [s390](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/390). A new [IBM LinuxONE System](https://www.ibm.com/partnerworld/systems/z/linuxone) without storage starts at about $135,000, so IBM is also investing a lot in the utility of [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) and community based open-source development. One thing for sure is that users of the [Open Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/) will experience some high-performance building after receiving compute assets benefiting open-source development.

In addition, SUSE sponsored two new [arm](https://www.arm.com/) servers that are the first of its specific hardware type in Germany. SUSE also contributed an additional x86-System for [rsync.opensuse.org](http://rsync.opensuse.org), which was deployed in the fall. The enhancement of the [rsync.opensuse.org](http://rsync.opensuse.org) system with its 42T direct-attached storage makes it possible to host a copy of all [download.opensuse.org](http://download.opensuse.org) content; this immediately helped [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) users across the globe since [mirrors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_site) replicate package updates to end-point users of the rolling release. Thanks to another sponsor, [IP-Exchange](https://www.ip-exchange.de/), rsync.opensuse.org is running in an external CoLocation Datacenter near Nuremberg.

The generosity to [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) extended not only from companies, but through individuals as well. Coly Li, who is working on [bcache](https://evilpiepirate.org/git/linux-bcache.git) in the kernel,  donated two 8TB SSDs for rsync.opensuse.org; [bcache](https://evilpiepirate.org/git/linux-bcache.git) is a block cache that allows people to use an SSD as a fast read/write cache for another block device. A big thank you to Li and all the companies who are for investing in the [openSUSE Project](https://www.opensuse.org/).
