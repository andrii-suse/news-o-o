Submitting bug reports related to [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/)’s traditional release over the years had some abnormalities as reporting bugs for [Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap)’s distribution had SUSE Linux Enterprise considerations. 

As the distribution evolved from the [Leap 42.1 hybrid](https://news.opensuse.org/2015/11/04/opensuse-leap-42-1-becomes-first-hybrid-distribution/) to the binary compatible [Leap 15.3](https://news.opensuse.org/2021/06/02/opensuse-leap-bridges-path-to-enterprise/) release and exorbitant reporting was necessary. The abnormalities of the process before caused contributors to be unable to see bugs referenced as fixes for SLE, which made it into Leap, but were not able to view them in [bugzilla.opensuse.org](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org).

That has now been streamlined, according to an email from Leap release manager Lubos Kocman.

“I'm excited to inform you that the days when developers were struggling to find Public SUSE Linux Enterprise * Bugzilla products (where all bugs are by default visible to the community) are finally over,” Kocman posted to the developer’s [mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/7JLAC2TJLPNOGOU2NTHMZZ7H2GDVGZRR/). “Public SLE products can be now seen in the default "Enter new bug" dialog at [bugzilla.opensuse.org](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org).”

The change of the bug reporting policy introduced larger utilization and amount of publicly accessible bugs in both Leap and SLE. Bugs against all Leap packages inherited from SLE should be reported in these Public SLE Products.

“We believe that this effort will increase the transparency of what exactly is being fixed in the update for Leap,” he wrote. “As in the past, … most of (the) referenced bugs in patchinfo were simply created as non-public by default. We're not taking that option away, but rather identified spots where we can be "open" by default. Namely [openQA](https://openqa.opensuse.org/) and now all bugs coming from Leap and SLE Beta testers that were not checked as private during creation.”

Leap release manager thanked members of the community for helping and progressing the efforts. The reporting change adds clarity and transparency for contributors.
