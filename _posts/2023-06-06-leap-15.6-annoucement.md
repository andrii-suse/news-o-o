We'd like to announce that the [openSUSE Release team](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Release_team) plans to work on openSUSE Leap 15.6. 

openSUSE Leap 15.6 is expected to be released in early June 2024 and would reach its end of life by the end of the year 2025.

This decision was based on recent discussions at SUSE Labs and openSUSE Conference, and it reflects recent changes, progress on individual projects, and [our new distribution architect](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/Y2UOB7TYMGL7TUTOWVELRN4VBRAVXPZI/). 

This will also enable us to provide SUSE customers with an updated Package HUB module, as both SLES 15 SP5 and Leap 15.6 would be considered a feature release based on our [tick-tock release model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick%E2%80%93tock_model).

With a Leap 15.6, more time is given for efforts related to [an ALP-based Leap 15.X successor](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/NDFLLVILAIY5E5RFQ5FO4CCJR6LSL2LZ/).

A more detailed explanation of the situation at lkocman's oSC2023 "Leap 16.0?" talk. Recording should be available within a few days at [the openSUSE youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@openSUSE).
