System administrators (sysadmins) are the unsung heroes of technology, and the [openSUSE Project](https://www.opensuse.org/) is thankful for all the [openSUSE heroes](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Heroes) that help our project to function.

Sysadmins are responsible for maintaining the backbone of our technology. They work behind the scenes to maintain infrastructure, security, and overall functionality of computer systems. 

[SysAdmin Day](https://sysadminday.com/) is celebrated every year on the last Friday of July and is a special occasion that recognizes the crucial role they play in keeping our digital world operational.

Some of the responsibilities include tasks like Installing, configuring, and maintaining hardware and software. They ensure system security, troubleshoot and solve problems. These individuals continuously learn and adapt while building positive work environments. Some might answer the phone asking if you “have you tried turning it off or on”. :joy:

These projections’ efforts are essential to the smooth running of businesses and organizations of all sizes. Without sysadmins, the digital world would grind to a halt and so would several open source projects. 

On this [SysAdmin Day 2023](https://sysadminday.com/), let us take a moment to thank these dedicated professionals; They deserve our appreciation.

Here are some ways to show your appreciation for your sysadmins on SysAdmin Day:

* Send them a gift from [shop.opensuse.org](https://shop.opensuse.org)
* Hand them a card or send email expressing your thanks
* Take them lunch or dinner.
* Buy them a beer

No matter what you choose, your sysadmins will be grateful for your kind gesture and show of appreciation. 

Thank you sysadmins for keeping our digital world running smoothly.

Happy SysAdmin Day!
