The community is headed to Berlin on June 19 for a [Community Summit](https://events.opensuse.org/) in association with [SUSE’s](https://www.suse.com/) premier annual global technical conference [SUSECON](https://www.suse.com/susecon/).

Registration for the event is open and the Call for Papers is open until May 29. Partners of SUSE, openSUSE, open source community projects and community members that want to participate are encouraged to register for the summit and submit a talk.

The schedule for the [Community Summit](https://events.opensuse.org/) will be released on May 30.

There is a Community track and an open source track. There are two types of talks that can be submitted for the summit. One is a short talk with a 15-minute limit and the other is a standard talk with a 30-minute limit. 

Attendees of  SUSECON are also welcome to attend and submit talks. The Community Summit is a free community event that will take place on the last day of SUSECON.

The summit will take place a week before the [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/) in Nuremberg, so attendees of SUSECON should consider staying for the openSUSE Project’s annual conference and submit a technical talk. For small- and medium-sized enterprises, there will be a 4-hour [Open 4 Business](https://news.opensuse.org/2024/01/12/conference-adds-business-focused-networking-event/) networking event held on June 26 next to SUSE’s offices in Nuremberg.

Contact ddemaio (@) opensuse.org if you have any questions concerning the summit.
