This is a short message from the openSUSE Board that we are posting on our communication channels and is a reminder that we ask each and every one of you to be kind, considerate and welcoming to people on all our communication channels. 

Let's foster a positive atmosphere for people on all of our communication channels. 

Our channels are a wonderful place for collaboration, but also remember that open-source is not about telling others what or how to build. 

How we communicate can benefit and/or hinder our community. Please do your part to always be welcoming, kind, mindful and respectful to one another, so that we can all help each other build a healthy community. The way we communicate can help us create a friendly environment for all. 

Also, we'd like to refer to our [Code of Conduct](https://code.opensuse.org/project/coc/blob/main/f/Code-of-Conduct.md).
