The start of an [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) [survey](https://survey.opensuse.org/) has begun, and users, open-source contributors and community members are encouraged to take the annual [survey](https://survey.opensuse.org/).

Last year the community started its [end of year survey](https://news.opensuse.org/2020/12/19/introducing-the-opensuse-2020-end-of-year-survey/) and [discussed the results](https://news.opensuse.org/2021/01/18/meetup-will-discuss-survey-results-project-improvements/) during a [community meeting](https://etherpad.opensuse.org/p/weeklymeeting).

The [results](https://en.opensuse.org/End-of-year-surveys/2020/Data) and meeting feedback guided changes in the timing and format of the current survey, which is now open for people to take. Some changes were made to the previous yearâ€™s questions and the survey will run until Feb. 28.

The survey is expected to provide insights on how people view and interact with the project. The survey will also help the community better understand the growing use of openSUSE distributions and tools.

The survey was expected to start in December of 2021, but due to another survey about community safety and the elections timing of the [openSUSE Board](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board), a decision was made to begin the survey in the new year. Please help us by taking the survey.
