[Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) snapshots didn’t lack excitement this week as multiple packages received updates and a couple major versions arrived for [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/) rolling release users this week.

The [20230809](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/JONO3B3IE6PM7XGJCDPLVCC7V7FYEY3A/) snapshot provided an update of [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/). [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/). The new 13.2.1+git7683 version for developers that rely on the compiler includes the 13.2 release and various fixes.

Tumbleweed users have the option of choosing between open GPU kernel modules or proprietary drivers and can get more information on [using NVIDIA GPU drivers on openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:NVIDIA_drivers#openSUSE-repos). Tumbleweed users are presented with a choice between open GPU kernel modules and proprietary drivers, and can find guidance on [using NVIDIA GPU drivers on openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:NVIDIA_drivers#openSUSE-repos). Within the openSUSE repositories, NVIDIA's proprietary drivers are available for installation through `zypper`. It's important to recognize that these proprietary drivers originate from the NVIDIA repository due to licensing restrictions. Additionally, users can enhance their experience with improved download accessibility and reduced latency by enabling the 3rd party NVIDIA repository.
