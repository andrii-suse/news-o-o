The joy of [Hack Week](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/) has begun!

This week is special for [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) and open-source contributors because it begins with the 22nd [Hack Week](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/) and ends with the return [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/), which is the globe's largest open-source community event.

[Hack Week](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/) runs through Feb. 3 and gives any open-source contributor a playground to experiment, innovate, collaborate and learn together.

Individuals and companies can join openSUSE contributors and development teams from [SUSE](https://www.suse.com/) for an entire week of collaborating on projects found at [hackweek.opensuse.org](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/). 

Anybody can create, join or view [projects listed on the site](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/22/projects). 

[One of the projects](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/22/projects/look-into-distrobox-as-a-launcher-of-desktop-and-applications-on-alp) listed in this yearâ€™s efforts is to investigate the current status of [distrobox](https://distrobox.privatedns.org/) support of desktop environments. It looks to use [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) as an example and check the desktop environments possible role to integrate with the [gdm-container](https://github.com/fcrozat/gdm- container) with the latest [ALP image](https://news.opensuse.org/2022/12/22/second-prototype-advances-alp/). [Another project](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/22/projects/explore-a-popular-desktop-distro-steam-deck-os) someone listed is to explore the immutable aspects of [Steam Deck OS](https://www.steamdeck.com/en/software) to gain some inspiration to help with [ALP](https://news.opensuse.org/2022/12/22/second-prototype-advances-alp/) development.

Some projects are focusing on [Rancher](https://www.rancher.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). One project is looking at [K3s Control Planes as a service](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/22/projects/k3s-control-planes-as-a-service) and another projects looks to develop [new functions to generate an upgrade image](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/22/projects/image-tools-simple-tool-for-mirror-slash-save-slash-load-container-images-and-kdm-and-chart-image-list-generator) list from KDM JSON data.

Projects do more than just finding solutions and advance new technologies. One of the more popular projects aims to [port some old classic 90s games](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/22/projects/port-some-classic-game-to-linux) like [Master of Orion II: Battle at Antares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Orion_II:_Battle_at_Antares).

There are more than 100 projects listed on the [Hack Week site](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/). 

Companies, hobbyists and technologists are encouraged to participate. There is no affiliation one needs to participate in [Hack Week](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/). Just join and have a lot of fun!

[Hack Week](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/) has been running since 2007 and the people involved with it have produced several useful open-source projects like [Weblate](https://weblate.org/en/), [openQA](https://open.qa/) and [openSUSE MicroOS](https://microos.opensuse.org/).
