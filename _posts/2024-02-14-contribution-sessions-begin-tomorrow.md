The [openSUSE](https://www.get.opensuse.org/) community is pleased to announce that it will have short sessions aimed at encouraging people on how to contribute to the project.

A group of volunteers will present short 15-minute sessions that are streamed and/or recorded on [openSUSE’s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@openSUSE) that are aimed at teaching people about packaging, using the [Open Build Service](https://openbuildservice.org/), creating tests for [openQA](http://open.qa/) and other development areas.

The [first session](https://calendar.opensuse.org/teams/marketing/events/contribution-workshop-obs) about “Basic use of OBS/osc using a version bump as an example” is set to begin tomorrow, on Feb. 15 at 21:00 UTC. 

Update: The “Packaging Guidelines (Patch Policies) and Submission of New Packages” session scheduled for Feb. 27 at 16:00 UTC has been postponed. 

More sessions are expected to be scheduled for future dates. 

The sessions are listed on the [openSUSE Calendar](https://calendar.opensuse.org/); look for the Contribution Workshop sessions marked in orange. 

Those who are interested in presenting should fill in the blank area for future sessions listed in the [email about the events](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/thread/JKPBGSLO3ZGKSBZMDV7LCYS7JCOVTY4S/). 

Giving a session is a great way to give back to the community and provides opportunities to teach others skills and knowledge about open-source development.
