For people planning on attending the [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org) 2022 in Nuremberg, Germany, from June 2 – 4, there are certain health and visa requirements that need to be met for travelers.

The openSUSE Conference will follow the [Bavarian Ministry of Health's](https://www.muenchen.de/int/en/events/corona-virus-current-rules-regulations.html) requirements and posture regarding COVID. An FFP-2 mask and social distancing may be required. These regulations my change before or up to the day of the conference.

Those who are not a citizen of a Schengen country that are planning to attend should view the overview of visa requirements/exemptions for entry into the Federal Republic of Germany, which can be found at the [Federal Foreign Office website](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/visa-service/-/231148).

Please note: the [Travel Support Program](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Travel_Support_Program) has no provisions to cover the cost of a visa, so it’s the travelers responsibility for covering the additional cost.

For citizens who are not a citizen of a Schengen country, you may need a formal invitation letter that fully explains the nature of your visit. An alphabetical list of people from nations that require an invitation letter can be found on the [Federal Foreign Office website](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/visa-service/-/231148). If the letter is needed, please contact the [conference organizers](https://en.opensuse.org/images/8/85/OSC22prospectus.pdf).
