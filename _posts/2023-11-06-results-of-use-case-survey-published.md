The [openSUSE Project](https://www.opensuse.org/) ran a [use-case survey](https://en.opensuse.org/Usecase2023) during the month of October and results are now available via [a 254-page report](https://en.opensuse.org/images/8/82/Usecase2023.pdf) and a [summary](https://en.opensuse.org/Usecase2023) of the survey’s findings is  on the community’s [wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/).

The survey provides a breakdown of the use cases of Linux among respondents based on their primary use of IT. 

The survey had general questions along with sections for Work/Business and Home/Hobby. Those who responded as using both, which if selected provides the surveyee the opportunity to take the entire [30-question](https://news.opensuse.org/2023/09/27/survey-to-explore-os-use-cases-more/) survey.
	
Questions on various IT technologies like cloud computing, containerization, configuration management, desktop computing, server infrastructure, serverless computing, virtualization, edge computing, IoT applications, machine learning, blockchain, gaming and a category of others were part of the survey. 

People were able to rate their use of these technologies as well as to provide comments for selective questions. The [raw text from the full report](https://en.opensuse.org/images/8/82/Usecase2023.pdf) was compiled to provide a [summary](https://en.opensuse.org/Usecase2023) for the ratings and use cases. 

People reviewing the report are more than welcome to enhance the [summary on the wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/Usecase2023).
