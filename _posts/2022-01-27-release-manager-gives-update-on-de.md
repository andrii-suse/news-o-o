The [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) community received cheerful news today after [Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap) release manager Luboš Kocman updated the community on the desktop environment expected for the [next minor release](https://get.opensuse.org/testing/).

[Leap 15.4](https://get.opensuse.org/testing/), which is in the alpha phase of the software release cycle, is planned to have updated desktop environments.

Kocman’s email [“KDE Plasma 5.24 LTS will be in Leap 15.4”](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/ZKKEYZNAPJSWVLURGRKL7HY3YQZIRKKP/) informed contributors on the Project’s [Factory mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/) that all the “dependencies are already submitted” to [SUSE Linux Enterprise](https://www.suse.com/products/server/). [Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap) is built with the same source code and exact same binary packages as SLE.
 
“We've received the green light,” Kocman wrote.

The feature is being tracked as [issue #7](https://code.opensuse.org/leap/features/issue/7). 

Currently, the Long-Term-Support release of [Plasma 5.24](https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.23.90/) is in it’s beta release cycle and will likely arrive in [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) soon.

Based on [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/)’s upstream schedule and the [roadmap](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Roadmap) for Leap, [GNOME 41.x](https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/41.0/) is expected to be in the release. The versions for [LXQt](https://lxqt-project.org/), [LXDE](http://www.lxde.org/), [Cinnamon](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon), [Mate](https://mate-desktop.org/), [XFCE](https://xfce.org/), [sway](https://en.opensuse.org/Sway) have yet to be finalized, according to [issue #9](https://code.opensuse.org/leap/features/issue/9), which is tracking the Desktop Environments’ latest version for the forthcoming version Leap.
