Are you ready for this yearâ€™s [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC23)? It will once again take place at the [Z Bau](//z-bau.com/haus), which was converted into a cultural center in 2014.

The [conference schedule](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC23/schedule) is now online abd live every year, and is packed with tons of great talks. It's a great place to do some hacking, socializing and learning new things about openSUSE and open-source software. 

System administrators, developers, Information Technology managers, startups, IT students and professors are welcome to attend. 

Here is a bit of information about Nuremberg. [Nuremberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg) is a German town located in [Bavaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria). It is the second most populated city in Bavaria behind [Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich). Nuremberg is located 170km north of Munich and 224km southeast of Frankfurt. Nuremberg is distinguished by its medieval architecture, including the fortifications and stone towers of its [Altstadt (Old Town)](//wikitravel.org/en/Nuremberg). At the northern edge of the Altstadt, surrounded by red-roofed buildings, stands [Kaiserburg Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle).

People who take the train will arrive in downtown Nuremberg. People coming in on a flight can go downtown using the subway ([U-Bahn](//www.vgn.de/en/airport)) from the airport. U2 is the train that goes too and from downtown (Hauptbahnhof). To get to the Z-Bau, you can take the U1 to Frankenstrasse. You'll see the new building for SUSE as you leave the subway. 

We are looking forward to seeing every at the conference next month. Please remember that there will be a preparty on May 25 at the [Kater Murr](//kater-murr.com/). Cya there!
