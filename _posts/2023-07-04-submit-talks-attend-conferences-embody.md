Staying up-to-date with the latest trends, tools and industry knowledge is crucial for open-source developers and  IT professionals like system administrators. 

Online resources provide valuable information, but there is no substitute for the immersive and collaborative experience of attending conferences. 

As the [openSUSE Conference](https://www.youtube.com/@openSUSE/videos) ended about a month ago and the [openSUSE.Asia Summit](https://events.opensuse.org/) is accepting [talk proposals until August 20](https://news.opensuse.org/2023/06/20/openSUSE-Asia-2023-CFP/), we will explore the benefits and reasons why people should not only attend conferences but actively contribute by submitting talks. 

The sharing of expertise and insights is perhaps the most fundamental of reasons to attend conferences as it provides an opportunity to share knowledge, expertise, and unique insights with a diverse audience. By submitting talks, people showcase their experiences, best practices, and innovative approaches to commonly shared challenges; they actively contribute to the growth and development of IT and open-source communities. These contributions can inspire others, spark new ideas and foster collaboration among attendees. Sharing expertise not only contributes to the collective knowledge but it helps to establish thought leaders and field experts.

Submitting talks and presenting it at conferences presents opportunities for personal and professional growth. It challenges people to refine their communication skills, overcome stage fright, and think critically about a topic. The experience of preparing and delivering a talk enhances people's ability to articulate complex concepts clearly and concisely. 

Attending sessions where speakers articulate a topic offers a unique opportunity to gain fresh perspectives, learn about emerging technologies, and stay ahead of the curve. The openSUSE and openSUSE.Asia Summit curate sessions with experts in open-source software and Linux, which provides valuable insights for attendees.

Many conferences like openSUSE and openSUSE.Asia Summit organize hands-on workshops where attendees gain practical experience and sharpen their skills. These interactive sessions allow IT professionals and developers to dive deep into specific technologies, frameworks, or tools. Attendees enhance their proficiency and return to their IT department with practical knowledge that can be immediately applied to their work.

Networking at conferences provides an invaluable chance to connect, exchange ideas, and establish meaningful relationships with industry peers and fellow community members. This helps to build a robust professional network that can lead to future collaborations, job opportunities, and mentorship possibilities.

Conferences like ours and others throughout the world foster a sense of community among attendees who share a common passion for technology and open-source. Engaging with fellow professionals and developers can lead to fruitful collaborations, collaborative projects, and contributions to open-source initiatives. The openSUSE and openSUSE.Asia Summit offer a vibrant community atmosphere and provide a platform for connecting with open-source enthusiasts from around the world.

For those managers and IT leaders that have not yet explored sending an employee to a conference, know that attending conferences provides immense value, but actively participating as a speaker takes the experience to new heights. 

Get started today by submitting a talk, especially to the openSUSE.Asis Summit; it will take place at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications in Chongqing, China, from Oct. 21 to 23.
